"You cannot have people who have no expertise in police work sit in judgment of police officers, because police work by its very nature is esoteric. When you have to have represented on that board every segment of the community, the gay segment, black, the Hispanic and so on, they tend to pursue a political agenda as opposed to looking at police behavior in an objective and fair fashion. So they can't be coming down with decisions that are fair.","For Police Union Head, Review Board Proposal Is Latest Indignity",4fd1d13d8eb7c8105d70bb37,3,1992-06-28T00:00:00Z,New York and Region
"In an interview with Tracy Clark-Flory on Salon, Ms. Decker carefully explains that asexuals distinguish between sexual arousal, sex drive and sexual attraction: â€œSexual arousal suggests a physiological response, sex drive suggests a desire to respond to arousal or a desire to pursue sex, and sexual attraction suggests an experience of finding someone sexually appealing.â€ù These distinctions are important, especially in the case of masturbation: â€œAn asexual person might have a libido and be able to get aroused, but not have those experiences directed at anyone.â€ù",Why Asexuals Donâ€™t Want to Be Invisible Anymore,54232178798810604c505435,4,2014-09-24T15:44:50Z,Unknown

"Stuart Elliott, The Timesâ€™s advertising columnist, is taking a running look at some of the eveningâ€™s Super Bowl commercials:  10:51 P.M.Final Thoughts on the Ad BowlWhat follows are some final thoughts on the ad bowl that was played inside Super Bowl XLV.*For all the discussion of how the commercials were being so widely shared before the game, one spot that is likely to be deemed a hit was a stealth spot for the Chrysler 200 that featured Eminem and took a strongly pro-Detroit and pro-American-auto-industry stance. It was not until Friday that it became known that the spot was going to be in the game, and as far as I can tell it may not have been available online before the game.*The movie category vied with the automotive category for supremacy in the game. If you toss in auto-related spots, like those for Bridgestone, CarMax and Cars.com, the auto category came out ahead. But with a surprise spot for the coming movie â€œLimitless,â€ù the tally for movie studios totaledÂ five â€” Disney, Paramount, Relativity, 20th Century Fox and Universal â€” and there were 10 movies advertised nationally in total.*It will be interesting to see how many viewers are re-watching the 20th Century Fox â€œRioâ€ù commercial as part of a promotion for the popular Angry Birds game. (A frame in the spot has a code embedded that directs players to a special level of the game.) Slotting the spot in the fourth quarter was also a clever move on the studioâ€™s part, given the gameâ€™s closeness.(By the way, the scenes from the movie, an animated film with birds, reminded some viewers of classic 20th Century Fox musicals with human performers like Carmen Miranda.)*It will also be interesting to see the post-game analysis on Madison Avenue of the appropriateness of the physical humor, risque language and sexy images that was part of so many of the commercials. In some cases, the spots that may raise the most eyebrows ran in the second half, but several ran in the first half.I saw at least one comment on Twitter from a mother saying she had to explain to a child what â€œrackâ€ù meant; the word was used in a spot for Teleflora in the second quarter and it was not in reference to a luggage rack atop a car.*All the predictions for the game to break the Nielsen ratings record for an American TV show, which was set last year by Super Bowl XLIV, could well be on track given how close the game was until the end. The record was 106.5 million; some forecasters say this game could draw 110 million viewers.10:14 P.M.A Close Score and Some SurprisesAnd that is it for Super Bowl XLV and the ad bowl inside the game. There were, by my count, 15 spots in the fourth quarter, which, when added to 12 in the third, 15 in the second and 18 in the first brings the national total in the game to an even 60.There were some surprises in the fourth quarter ad line-up. There was a commercial from Verizon, promoting its iPhone service, which had not been announced before the game.In a seeming surprise, Chevrolet apparently bought another ad slot, to run a humorous 60-second commercial for Camaro that executives had been considering before the game but were not sure whether they could squeeze it in. Given all the eyeballs that must have been watching the game at that point, with the score so close, it may have been a good decision.Another surprise was a spot for a movie from Relativity Media, â€œLimitless,â€ù which also did not turn up in any pre-game lists of spots to run in the game. The commercial had run in the pre-game show, so its turning up in the fourth quarter was doubly surprising.Some final thoughts on the ad bowl shortly.9:54 P.M.Glee and the GleefulAnother close game. The advertisers must be as full of glee as the game has been full of promotions for â€œGlee.â€ù(And did anyone notice the spots that promoted a Chevrolet commercial that is going to run in the episode of â€œGleeâ€ù that follows the Super Bowl? Yes, commercials to promote a commercial.)The second of two Bridgestone tire spots, called â€œCarma,â€ù pun intended, was an example of an interesting trend in this game. Many commercials are forgoing dialog or voice-over announcers and using only music and title cards on screen. Others include both spots for Coca-Cola, the Volkswagen Beetle and Volkswagen Passat spots and the Motorola Xoom spot.The reason for the trend could be that advertisers are considering the environment in which many people watch the Super Bowl: noisy, crowded parties. Why have dialog or voice-over chatter when viewers may not be able to hear it? It is like bringing back silent films, which got a shout-out in the Hyundai Sonata hybrid spot in the fourth quarter.9:43 P.M.The Fourth QuarterInto the fourth quarter of the game, and the ads, and certain creative elements of the spots, are starting to recur.A spot for the Paramount Pictures animated film, â€œRango,â€ù which is based on classic westerns, is at least the fourth ad in the game to evoke western imagery. The others were for another movie, â€œCowboys and Aliens,â€ù a spot for Budweiser and a spot for Cars.com.And in a Pepsi Max commercial â€” the third in the game that was created by consumers â€”Â a man says the word â€œdamn,â€ù which until Super Bowl XLV may never have been uttered previously in a Super Bowl spot. But it was not the first â€œdamn,â€ù as the Lipton Brisk spot with Eminem in the first quarter used the oath earlier.Other risque language in the commercials included â€œrack,â€ù in a Teleflora spot, and a double entendre in a Mini spot, based on the fact that the British use the word â€œbootâ€ù to mean the trunk of a car.9:30 P.M.A Nod to the FansThe third quarter is finished, adding another 12 spots, by my count, to the total so far in the game. With 18 in the first quarter and 15 in the second, that totals 45.The National Football League spot that just ran was cute and certainly must have warmed the hearts of TV fans everywhere. Plus it will be the kind of spot that will be played over and over again on Web sites like YouTube after the game. But such N.F.L. spots are typically not counted in the commercial tallies because the league does not pay to run the spots; the air time is donated by the network that is broadcasting the game.Meantime, the debate online about the Groupon spot in the third quarter goes on. Some commenters on Twitter are noting that Groupon is offering a chance to donate to the causes that it seems to be making light of. But the commercial did not mention that opportunity or wink at viewers to let them know Groupon was not being callous or exploiting social causes.The donation information is on a microsite, or special Web site, savethemoney.com, which is also the theme of the Groupon spots. It does not seem to be on groupon.com.9:14 P.M.Introducing a Car â€” and a CityThe Chrysler 200 spot that just ran may have made Super Bowl ad history in that it filled an entire commercial pod, or break.The commercial boldly took issue with prevailing attitudes about Detroit and the cars it makes and featured Eminem in his second appearance in an ad in the game. (The first was for Lipton Brisk.)The Chrysler GroupÂ played the spotâ€™s existence close to the vest; word that the company was going to devote its entire Super Bowl ad buy to one car and one spot did not begin circulating until Friday.The spot seems in the vein of PresidentÂ Barack Obamaâ€™s â€œWin the futureâ€ù initiative, with its insistence that â€œimported from Detroit,â€ù as the screen read at the end, is a virtue to be heralded rather than a fact to be concealed.Personal note, as someone who lived and worked in Detroit for three years, it was good to see support for the city expressed in so public a venue.9:03 P.M.A Bit of MisdirectionMore contention in the ad bowl?Not long after the HomeAway spot with a dummy baby hitting a wall, along comes a spot for Groupon, the online discount couponer, that seems to make light of the plight of Tibet.Early comments on Twitter are mostly harshly critical of the Groupon commercial. Groupon and its agency, Crispin Porter & Bogusky, are to run three spots altogether, all of which take the misdirection tack on a social issue of concern to many.The other spots are about, or seem to be about, the loss of the Brazilian rain forest and the disappearance of whales.The tack is popular right now, using shock humor as a tactic, and it is practiced mostly by telecommunications companies like Boost Mobile and, to some extent, Sprint. With Groupon being such a new, or unknown, company, to so many viewers, it is going to be fascinating to watch if this first exposure will backfire or not.8:53 P.M.Back to the Ad BowlBack to the ad bowl within the Super Bowl, with two quick breaks.In the first pod, the Cars.com commercial included a scene with cowboys, making it at least the third spot so far with western characters. The others were a Budweiser spot and a spot for the movie â€œCowboys and Aliens.â€ùHmmmm. Was the fact that â€œCowboys and Aliensâ€ù was to be advertised in the game an inspiration to folks who were creating the Super Bowl spots?The Best Buy commercial. What was that? Does Ozzy Osbourne saying â€œbloodyâ€ù count toward the ad bowlâ€™s racy language so far, with â€œdamnâ€ù in theÂ Lipton Brisk spot and â€œrackâ€ù in the Teleflora spot?And speakingÂ of which,Â how many viewers will be arguing over the intent of the game-show parody in the Mini Countryman spot? It all will come down to whether you believe â€œcram it in the bootâ€ù is a double entendre or just a British game show.The HomeAway spot with the â€œtest babyâ€ù getting smushed against a window counts toward the slapstick violence that isÂ so prevalent in many of the Super Bowl spots. Or does it, since it is a dummy?8:14 P.M.Tallying the First HalfWell, the first half of the game is over, and so, too, is the first half of the ad bowl inside the Super Bowl.There have been 33 national spots so far, by my count, with 18 in the first quarter and 15 in the second.So far the running order of the commercials is pretty much the way that advertisers said it would be before the game â€” that is, those advertisers that chose to share such information with reporters.The main change so far seems to be that a spot for Sony Ericsson, which was to have run in the second quarter, ran after the quarter ended and just before the halftime show began.Usually, such spots are not counted in the polls and surveys of consumersâ€™ reactions to ads during the game; most notably, the Super Bowl Ad Meter conducted by USA Today usually omits spots that are not within the four quarters of the game.The major themes so far: outer space is in, the language is more frank than in previous games (at least for games played after â€œNipplegateâ€ù) and there are going to be almost as many spots for movies as there are going to be for cars.Time for dinner and a bathroom break.7:52 P.M.Watching Roseanne BarrThe most recent commercial pod, or break, was stuffed with interesting spots.Snickers. Too much like last yearâ€™s Betty White/Abe Vigoda? If so, is that bad, given how hugely popular the 2010 spot was? And could this commercial revive Roseanne Barrâ€™s TV career the way the spot last year helped bring back Betty White?CareerBuilder. Bringing back the chimpanzees. Could be controversial because since the last time they were on the Super Bowl there has been a movement in the ad industry against using primates for ad purposes. The spot was created internally and not by an agency.â€œSuper 8,â€ù a coming film from Paramount Pictures. Another spot with aliens, outer space, rocket shipsÂ and other science fiction elements. Others so far have included a spot for â€œCowboys and Aliens,â€ù a commercial for Kia and a spot for the Chevrolet Volt.7:41 P.M.Is the Force with Volkswagen?It will be fascinating to watch the response to the Volkswagen Passat spot with the â€œStar Warsâ€ù imagery and music because a longer version already has 13 million views on YouTube.I wonder if VW and its agency, Deutsch L.A., are not kicking themselves for running a 30-second version in the game rather than the 60-second version that is getting all the views on YouTube.Speaking of social media, several advertisers like Budweiser ended their spots with the Web addresses of their Facebook pages rather than their Web sites. And Audi ended its spot with a Twitter hashtag, #ProgressIs; that may be a Super Bowl ad first.7:33 P.M.Rivals and Racy LanguageIs this the racy-language ad bowl?First, Eminem says â€œdamnâ€ù in a spot for Lipton Brisk, then an actor in a Teleflora spot with Faith Hill uses the word â€œrackâ€ù in describing his girlfriendâ€™s, er, um, charms. Could this be because the game is on Fox?Interesting that BMW ran both its Super Bowl ads in the same commercial pod, or break, in the first and third positions with a spot for the Motorola Xoom tablet in the middle, between them.Also interesting is that in the funny BMW diesel spot, there are rival cars, clearly identifiable, a Mercedes-Benz and a Volvo. This also is a trend, in that the Audi spot in the first quarter had a Mercedes visible, too.7:25 P.MCrashing the Super BowlThe first quarter is over, and with it the ads slated to run in the first quarter.There were 18, including 5 of the 6 spots for Doritos and Pepsi Max created by consumers in the annual Crash the Super Bowl contest. Again, there was little fanfare that the spots were made by consumers rather than by Madison Avenue professionals.The Lipton Brisk spot, with Eminem, is the first of two spots in the game featuring him. Look for a Chrysler 200 spot later with him, too.The Lipton Brisk spot may have made Super Bowl ad history when the Claymation version of Eminem said â€œdamn.â€ù Also, it was the second spot in the game â€” and the third since 6 p.m. â€” that made reference to commercials and making commercials.7:19 P.M.Cowboys, Aliens andâ€_.AliensThe first of the content coincidences has taken place, almost at the end of the first quarter, when two spots in the same pod, or break, contain similar elements.A commercial for â€œCowboys and Aliens,â€ù a coming film from Universal Pictures, was followed by a spot for Kia called â€œOne Epic Rideâ€ù with cinematic characters that includedÂ â€_ aliens.There were a couple of content coincidences last year, one of which led to bad blood between advertisers because two spots in a row both had punch lines that involved men not wearing pants.6:41 P.M.Battle of the CouponsThe battle of the online discount couponers is a big story in this ad bowl inside the Super Bowl.Groupon bought a spot in the game, as well as before and after, while a rival, LivingSocial, bought a spot in the pre-game. That spot, which just ran, echoes a commercial for GoDaddy.com in showing a burly man that at the end of the spot is dressed like a woman.Yes, in 2011, advertisers still believe that transsexuals or cross-dressing is something to laugh at.Those who disliked the LivingSocial spot, get ready for the Groupon spot, in the third quarter. It may raise more hackles than any Super Bowl spot since the Snickers commercial that presented two men accidentally kissing as something awful.6:39 P.M.WelcomeMedia Decoder is gearing up to live-blog the Super Bowl XLV commercials.Super Bowl Sunday is the biggest day of the year for advertising as well as for football, as a long list of marketers â€” blue-chip mainstays and green rookies â€” gamble that getting their message in front of perhaps as many as 110 million viewers is worth paying something like $100,000 for each second of air time.The commercial time during the final 30 minutes before the game is dominated by advertisers that did not buy spots in the game: Ford Motor, Pizza Hut and Sony Pictures. Pizza Hut had initially said it would advertise during the game, but recently changed its corporate mind and withdrew.The pre-game brought the nightâ€™s first self-referential commercial, a spot from Sony Pictures for the coming film â€œJust Go With It,â€ù which showed a beautiful young woman in a revealing bathing suit emerging from the ocean. It is â€œthe only commercial thatâ€™s worth an instant replay,â€ù an announcer says, clearly speaking to the men in the audience despite the fact that tens of millions of women watch the Super Bowl, too.As for which spots are worth or not worth watching again, that is going to be interesting to see. The Google home page, normally so clean, is already urging, â€œWatch the TV ads from the 2011 Super Bowl on YouTube.â€ù And a 60-second version of a 30-second Super Bowl spot for the Volkswagen Passat, featuring â€œStar Warsâ€ù imagery and music, has already been watched more than 12 million tims on youtube.com. That is astonishing.",Ad Watch: The Super Bowl Commercials,4fd39e9e8eb7c8105d8e17fd,84,2011-02-06T18:39:10Z,Business
